h2. Introduction

This is a fork of http://github.com/alexyoung/ico/tree. It adds hover effects and information and stacked area charts to the library, amongst a host of other things.

This version still supports all of the original graphs and api options.

h3. new options

* added a stack graph, can be filled or can be lines
* added google analytics-style extra information interactivity to all items
* added an option to allow linegraphs to start at a non-zero horizontal steps
* Added various api options to edit the new functionality, such as hover color, showing percentages in the horizontal bar graph labels, allowing the first item of a bar chart to be a different colour (todo: make working for standard bar graph)
* fixed bug with vertical line drawing in horizontal bar graph
* halved the amount of steps when above 100 for more spacious looking graphs
* added the option to add a watermark over your graph, via a link or an img element
